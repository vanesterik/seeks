# SEEKS

**SEEKS** is a REPL shell program and manages the execution of AI-based systems. It is a structured execution environment that allows the user to interact with the AI-based system and manage the execution of the system. The program is designed to be modular and can be extended to support different types of AI-based systems.

## Motivation

The motivation for this project is twofold:
1. To provide a structured execution environment for AI-based systems - ie. OpenAI's GPT-3, Anthropic's Claude, etc.
2. To develop skills in database management, data processing, and python programming in general.

## Name

The name **SEEKS** is an abbreviation play on the title "Structured Execution Environment of Knowledge Systems". It is also part of the name of a character being who appeared in the episode [Meeseeks and Destroy](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt3333832/) of the Rick and Morty series, where Beth, Summer and Jerry try to get their every wish fulfilled by asking mr. Meeseeks. Which resembles the usage of AI-based systems to fulfill our every wish. The name **SEEKS** is a homage to that episode.

## Installation

Use the following command to install the project:

```bash
make install
```

## Usage

Use the following command to run the project:

```bash
make run # to run the trade platform
```

The run command will start the shell program.
